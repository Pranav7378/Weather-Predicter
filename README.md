## üöÄ Live Demo
üîó **[Try the Weather Predictor App ‚Üí](https://indiancityweatherpredictionwithprophet.streamlit.app)** Select your desired Indian city and forecast range to see daily average temperature predictions powered by Facebook Prophet, along with a live comparison to vendor forecasts.

---

## üí° About the Project
A **full-stack time series forecasting project** that leverages **Facebook Prophet** to predict daily average temperatures for major Indian cities. This model is trained on 10 years of historical weather data and continuously evaluated against real-time vendor forecasts from Visual Crossing using **MAE** and **RMSE** metrics.

**Cities Covered:**
* Mumbai
* Delhi
* Chennai
* Bangalore
* Hyderabad

---

## ‚ú® Key Features
* **Cost-Efficient Deployment**: Built and deployed entirely for **‚Çπ0** using free tools and services.
* **Interactive UI**: Intuitive **Streamlit UI** allowing users to select cities and customize forecast ranges.
* **Live Comparison**: Real-time **model vs. vendor forecast comparison** with dynamic error metrics (MAE, RMSE).
* **Integrated Workflow**: Seamless **GitHub, Google Colab, and Git LFS** workflow for development and large file management.
* **Offline Mode**: Designed to run efficiently using cached models, ensuring reproducibility and zero running costs.

## üéØ Challenges Overcome
* **API Rate Limits**: Successfully transitioned from OpenWeatherMap to **Meteostat** and **Visual Crossing** to circumvent API limitations.
* **Large File Management**: Utilized **Git LFS** to efficiently store and track large `.pkl` model files within the repository.
* **Cost & Reproducibility**: Engineered the application to run effectively offline on pre-cached models, making it entirely cost-free to operate and easy to reproduce.

---

## üìà Impact
* Achieved **portfolio-ready results** with impressive accuracy, including **RMSE < 0.5 ¬∞C** for cities like Mumbai and Chennai.
* Demonstrates comprehensive skills in **data pipeline management, machine learning model training, API integration, application deployment, and live analytics**.
